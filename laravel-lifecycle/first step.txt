1.Auto Loader:
------------
The entry point for all requests to a laravel application is the public/index.
php file
All requests are derected to this file by your web 
server(apache/Nginx)configaration.The index.php file donen't comtain much code.
rather its a starting point for loading rest of the famwork.
its loads all auto loader files that we are create throw composer.


2.Karnel:
------------
Next step will occur on the kernel part of the application.our all sending 
request will come
aither http kernel or console kernel.HTTP kernel is just recive a request 
and return a response.bootstrapper are
defined by kernel class.its help to error handling,confiure logging,detect 
enviroments and other tast to be done
befor request handling.


3.Service Providers
---------------------
Next step for kernel is to load service providers as bootstrapping actions.
service providers have to method one is registered and onother is boot method.
when register method called then registered all service providers and after registred
all service provider then boot method will be called.


4.Dispatch Request:
-------------------
Once the application have beed bootstrapped and all service providers are registered
and booted,the request will be handed over to ther router for dispatching.
the request will dispatch to a route or controller ,as well as run any route specific
middleware


5.Router:
--------
Now request will be dispatched by the Router and it will end up with the views

Router will direct the HTTP Request to a Controller or return a view or responses directly by omitting the controller. These routes will be placed in app/routes.php.

Controller app/controllers/ performs specific actions and sends data to a View.

View app/views/ formats the data appropriately, providing the HTTP Response.
